            <p>
                The Deity Theos 2TX1RX Kit is a professional wireless audio system that includes two transmitters (TX) and one receiver (RX), making it perfect for dual-channel audio setups. 
                It’s designed to deliver broadcast-quality audio for filmmakers, content creators, and sound engineers.

                The receiver (RX) is compact and can be mounted directly to a camera or sound recorder via a cold shoe mount. The system is designed for simplicity and ease of use, featuring OLED displays on both the transmitters and receiver for real-time monitoring of audio levels, battery life, and signal strength.

                The kit is powered by rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, offering up to 10 hours of continuous operation, making it ideal for long shooting days.
